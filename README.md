# Weather app Android
This was an interview test to demonstrate my capacity to deliver a working application
under a time limit (about 3-4 hours) and other constraints.

It uses [open weather map api](http://openweathermap.org/api) to display the weather of a given location.

## Uses

* Retrofit 2
* Dagger 2
* MVP

Thing I would like to add 

* More dagger
* Rx
